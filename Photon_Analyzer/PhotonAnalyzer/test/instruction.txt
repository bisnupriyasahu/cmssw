The MyClass.C file just makes the various histograms needed for fitting with roofit using fits_.C
The histograms inside MyClass.C are named accordingly so hopefully you can understand how they are filled.
TO run it:

Inside CMSSW/src do:


1)cmsenv
2) root -l  /hdfs/store/user/gomber/Monophoton_2017_data_94X/SinglePhoton/crab_sPho_dataset2/181023_204241/0000/ggtree_data_104.root
3) Inside root do these steps
[0] _file0->cd("ggNtuplizer")
[1] EventTree->MakeClass("nour1")
[2] .q

4) after excuting root commands you will get two files nour1.C and nour1.h
5) replace // Declaration of leaf types and // List of branche together with "// Set object pointer in the MyClass::Init function " from Mycl\
ass.h by that found in nour1.h

6)make - this will produce a MyClass.exe executable file
7)./MyClass.exe /hdfs/store/user/gomber/Monophoton_2017_data_94X/SinglePhoton/crab_sPho_dataset1/181023_204043/0000/ Bh_2017_set1_0000.root -\
1 10000

-1 is running on all events inside the INPUTFILE directory - you can modify this
10000 is giving a printout after 10000 events - you can modify this

8) Run for all input folders in the tuples
9) hadd Attia_NV_2017.root *.root
Once you have the output file, then you can use the fits_test.C file which will do Z invariant mass fit for failing and passing probes and gi\
ve you their numbers inside the range of interest (for eg under Z peak 80-100).

10) to get the fitted plots do
  root -l -q fits_sayed.C
